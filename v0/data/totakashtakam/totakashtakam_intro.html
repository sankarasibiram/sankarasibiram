            Sri Adi Sankaracarya had a sishya named Giri. He was not learned like the other sishyas. However, he was
            ever attentive and studious in serving the acarya.
            <P></P>
            Once, other sishyas became patient as acarya was waiting for Giri to start the day's lessons. Observing this, 
            acarya bestowed all the knowledge of the sastras to Giri. On entering the class, Giri prased his Guru, Sri Sankaracarya, 
            in eight verses composed in Totaka, a difficult chandas. This stotra is called Totakashtakam.
            Observing the beauty and eloquence of the work, Giri, was henceforth called Totakacarya.
            <P></P>
            Even today, it is customary to read or sing the Totakashtaka and do sashtanga namaskaram after every verse to Sri Sankaracarya.
